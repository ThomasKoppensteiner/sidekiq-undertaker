## About

Sidekiq::Undertaker is a plugin for [Sidekiq](https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq).
It allows exploring, reviving (retrying) or burying (deleting) dead jobs.
For easy exploring the dead-jobs queue is broken down into time windows (buckets) of hours, days and weeks.

## Installation

#### Install the Gem

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

````ruby
  gem "sidekiq-undertaker"
````

And then execute:
````sh
  $ bundle
````

Or install it yourself as:

````sh
  $ gem install sidekiq-undertaker
````

#### Development: Install the Rubocop Pre-Commit Hook

## Impressions

#### Filter View

The filter page shows a table with time-buckets as columns and rows for each job class.

#### Job Filter View

For each job class, you can drill down to view error distribution based on
error class.

#### Morgue View
Finally, click on the individual error counts to display details of the
errors in a list form.

The morgue view can, for example, also show an error distribution over all job classes.
